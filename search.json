Therefore, the eastern civilization (China) can be deemed as a unified culture. In the geographical scope of China in East Asia, there is a stable and continuous history process of one-by-one unified dynasties (empires). Between two old and new unified dynasties in the history of China, there are always chaotic (transitional) periods when several local regimes competed for the absolute power of China (the Mandate of Heaven). In these transitional periods, wars and annexations are always inevitable. Then, only one local regime will succeed in gaining that power, forming a new unified dynasty (empire). The cultural pattern is obviously different in the western world, and there are no stable unification patterns. In Europe, there were also chaotic periods, with wars and annexations. However, there is no stable pattern of unification, which means that no local regimes (countries) have unified mainland Europe. Hence, whether this process can be modeled and revealed? We believe that computational methods can reveal some laws and rules of historical dynamics. For this work, we need to solve the conditions of both the unity and disunity. To achieve this goal: first, we build an agent-based model of general history dynamics for the chaotic periods; second, we run the simulations to explore outcomes of the unity and disunity; last, we obtain valid solutions for both the unity of China and the disunity of the West world. It suggests that our valid solutions explain the disunity between China and Europe patterns. Moreover, we can calculate the conditional boundaries of both unity (China) and disunity (Europe). Thus, the unification process in human history may be universal, but the outcomes or patterns may be different under different conditions.\n\n**Keywords**: Agent-based model; History dynamics; Unity versus Disunity; Civilization patterns; China and Europe\n\n<div class=\"mdh-post_textAlign_center\">\n    <img class=\"mdh-post_block-item\" style=\"max-width: 80%;margin-bottom: 16px;\" src=\"/img/news/identify_unification_conditions_of_human_civilization2.png\">\n</div>\n\nFigure 1.

However, it can be contained, if they can be organized and behave intelligently. To obtain this swarm intelligence pattern, social knowledge should be captured to guide behaviors of isolated individuals. Here, we explore how swarm intelligence can be achieved by individual behaviors during social learning process. We have solved two issues. The first is to obtain social knowledge. Based on agent-based model of real target case, we calculate the optimal solution based on which we infer outcomes of all possible situations. Then, the matrix of social knowledge can be formed; The second is social learning process of individuals. Guided by the social knowledge, they all know that others will be mobilized as well. The key information is the minimal valid size of heroes, and all social members know that this condition is not difficult to satisfy. Thus, more individuals will be mobilized and become the Heroes to fight bravely against the shooter(s). Comparing two patterns, we obtain precise outcomes of how social losses (civilian deaths and injuries) can be reduced. Therefore, guided by clear social knowledge, social welfare can be enhanced substantially.\n\n**Keywords**: Social knowledge；Agent-based model；Swarm intelligence；Counterfactuals\n\n<div class=\"mdh-post_textAlign_center\">\n    <img class=\"mdh-post_block-item\" style=\"max-width: 80%;margin-bottom: 16px;\" src=\"/img/news/Individual_behaviors_using_real_case2.png\">\n</div>\n\nFig. 1.

This paper uses an agent-based model to put forward the optimist decisions of independent restaurants in O2O food ordering and delivery markets.\n\n**Abstract:** In the booming online-to-offline (O2O) food ordering and delivery market, numerous independent restaurants are competing for orders placed by customers via online food ordering platforms. The food quality and location decisions are deemed the two principal considerations of restaurants in this emerging market. To investigate restaurants' evolutionary food quality and location behaviors, we propose an agent-based O2O food ordering model (AOFOM) consisting of three types of agents: customers, restaurants, and the online food ordering platform. We explicitly model their adaptive behaviors by optimizing the agents' benefits. We find that customers' behaviors significantly impact the restaurants' food quality decisions. Besides, the relationship between the restaurant's location decisions and customers' waiting time is less significant in the O2O food ordering market due to an equalizing delivery service provided by the online platform. We also examine the characteristics of the best restaurants and the impacts of different delivery policies on the food quality and location decisions of restaurants.\n\n**Keywords:** Agent-based model; Online-to-offline; Food ordering; Food delivery; Location\n\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">1. Background</div>\nModern information technologies provide people with a new option of eating under online-to-offline transactions. Restaurants, customers, and online platforms can all benefit from these transactions. However, due to the difficulty of attracting online takeaway orders and the time-sensitive nature of takeaway food, the restaurant's sales territory is bounded by an online food ordering platform. Therefore, how should restaurants' operations management (OM) be optimized in competitive O2O food ordering and delivery markets becomes a question for researchers and restaurant managers. With rich survey data and annual reports from iResearch and researchers’ observations, the article suggests that food quality and location decisions are the two principal considerations of restaurants. In the article, researchers employ the agent-based modeling (ABM) technique to create an agent-based O2O food ordering model (AOFOM) grounded in complex adaptive system (CAS) theory which helps to study the optimal decisions of independent restaurants in O2O food ordering and delivery markets.\n\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">2. Literature Review</div>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">O2O:</div>\nAs firms have increasingly adopted the O2O approach, researchers have devoted much research to this topic. In general, research on the O2O approach can be divided into four streams, namely channel-related, product/service-related, customer-related, and technology-related.\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">Competitive location models:</div>\nAs the first study on competitive location problems, Hotelling (1929) has spurred voluminous subsequent research on this topic, which can be generally grouped into two divisions according to the competition type, i.e., static or dynamic.\nStatic spatial competitions are often framed as one-stage Operations Research (OR) problems (Kress and Pesch, 2012), which seek the optimal location(s) for one competitor without considering the others' reactions. However, it is increasingly difficult for such analytical models to capture dynamic spatial interactions between facilities and customers.\nPlayers in dynamic locational competitions repeatedly re-optimize their locations simultaneously (such as Hotelling, 1929) or sequentially (pioneered by Hakimi, 1983). However, due to the complexity of dynamic spatial competitions with many players, such models are usually complicated to solve using game-theoretic approaches.\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">Food-related operations management:</div>\nFrom the OM viewpoint, food-related studies generally focus on three research strands. The first is food quality management due to its importance to public health. The second research strand is food supply chain management, particularly the distribution network design. The third research strand concerns service competition among food service providers.\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">Agent-based modeling:</div>\nAn agent can be viewed as an abstract entity, and multiple agents form a complex adaptive system (CAS). In recent years, CAS theory has received considerable attention due to a growing need to tackle difficult issues in market competition. Currently, the most similar study is He et al. (2018a), in which an empirically-grounded agent-based framework is proposed for the OM of mobile application startups. Apart from the similarities with the AOFOM model in this paper, there are fundamental differences between these two models. Therefore, this paper is the first study on the service OM of restaurants in the emerging O2O food ordering and delivery market.\n\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">3. Modelling</div>\nWith the basis of explicitly defining each agent's attributes and behaviors interacting with other agents, the flow of AOFOM is generally divided into five stages: model and agent initialization, customers place orders, food preparation, and delivery, restaurants make new decisions, and information update and model termination.\n      In the stage of model and agent initialization, agents are created.\n      In the stage of customers placing orders, customers search for information from the platform and then evaluate alternatives and place orders.\n      In the food preparation and delivery stage, the platform sends orders to restaurants and receives estimated pick-up time. Then, the foods are prepared by restaurants and delivered by the platform.\n      In the stage of making new decisions, Restaurants make further decisions on food quality and location.\n      Customers send feedback in the information update and model termination stage, and the platform updates information. If it meets termination criteria, the model terminates. If not, it goes back to the location of customers placing orders.\n\n<div class=\"mdh-post_textAlign_center\">\n    <img class=\"mdh-post_block-item\" style=\"max-width: 80%;margin-bottom: 16px;\" src=\"/img/news/O2O_markets_abo.png\">\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">4. Conclusion</div>\nThe following conclusions can be drawn from this study—first, customers' preference behaviors significantly impact the restaurants' food quality decisions. For example, if customers prefer higher-quality food, the restaurants will increase their quality. Second, the restaurant's food quality will be fine with improving food preparation efficiency because it is mainly based on customers' choices. Forth, the best restaurants have features of having higher food quality and more significant uncertainty in decision-making.\n\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">5. Contribution</div>\nThis study has three main contributions. First, this paper is the first study on the service OM of restaurants in the emerging O2O food ordering and delivery market. Therefore, the findings offer timely and meaningful insights into numerous independent restaurants' food quality and location strategies. Second, researchers employ the agent-based modeling technique to model the market rather than mathematical approaches. Therefore, the complex, dynamic, and non-linear agent interactions can be well captured. Third, based on the accumulated order count, researchers divide all restaurants into two groups (the best ones and others) and analyze the differences in their decisions to understand what strategies are more likely to help restaurants succeed in the competition.\n\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">6. Insights for future research</div>\nThis study has three main insights for future research. First, price, minimum order quantity, and other elements neglected in our model can be considered for a more realistic result. Second, more profound research on the operations management of the online food ordering platform could be exciting and necessary as it plays a vital role in the market. Finally, it is worth collecting and using individual-level behavioral information and other empirical data for further agent-based studies on the O2O food ordering and delivery market.\n\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">7.

This paper primarily summarizes the development of scholars’ understanding of the crucial role that artifacts and the materiality play during the course of routines. We then focus on the material artifacts-based exploration and exploitation carried out by multiple human actors, and create a link between individual situated actions at the micro-level and the collective outcome as patterned routines. This discloses the underlying logic between human actors’ exploration and exploitation of material artifacts on the one hand, and the ‘(re)framing-overflowing’ interaction loop amidst routine performances and artifacts as artifactual representations (D’Adderio, 2008; 2011) on the other. Subsequently, this study uses an agent-based approach to formalize routines formation dynamics from the ‘bottom-up’. Our simulation results highlighted the relationships between the three crucial aspects – which include the interdependences between situated-actions within and between organizational tasks, artifacts-based explorative and exploitative activities carried out by multiple human actors, and organizational structures or the power asymmetry characterizing interpersonal relationships within the routine system. The research work theoretically enriches people’s understanding of routines formation dynamics over time, and provides indications for managers in designing routine performances via the artifacts.\n\n**Keywords**: Organizational Routines, Routine Dynamics, Artifacts, Exploration and Exploitation, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)\n\n<div class=\"mdh-post_textAlign_center\">\n    <img class=\"mdh-post_block-item\" style=\"max-width: 80%;margin-bottom: 16px;\" src=\"/img/news/ABM2.png\">\n</div>\n\nFigure 1.

However, the existing studies focus on the results of land transfer and lack in-depth investigation of the decision-making process and behavioral mechanisms. This study uses a simulation model to simulate the behavior rules and dynamic processes of farmers' land transfer under the background of urbanization and rural aging. Being calibrated with real data, the model is validated by matching its outputs with farmland transfer data in sample villages. The preliminary application of the model in several scenarios provides intuitive reference for farmland transfer policy-making. This study reveals the mechanisms underlying farmers' decision-making in spontaneous farmland transfer and bottom-up farmland concentration at the village level. It provides a benchmark model for examining the mechanisms and processes of farmland transfer and concentration in more complex conditions. The model can be a powerful tool for the pre-evaluation of farmland transfer policies.\n\n**Keywords**: spontaneous farmland transfer; rural aging; urbanization; simulation model; agent-based modeling\n\n**1. Background**\n   Agricultural land circulation is the only way of agricultural scale management in China, which provides the necessary basic conditions for realizing agricultural and rural modernization and rural industry revitalization. The transfer of land contract management right is an important decision for farmers to reconfigure household production factors under the condition of changing management constraints, which reflects the micro-process of optimizing the allocation of agricultural resources in China under the dynamic macro situation. Literatures focus on the result of land transfer, and generally use econometric models to analyze its influencing factors, lacking explicit and intuitive analysis of the decision-making process and behavior mechanism of rural household land transfer, and it is difficult to describe the dynamic process of the change of land management right structure and land concentration at the village level. Compared with the econometric model, the computer simulation model can more systematically describe the complex characteristics and variable relationships involved in farmer household land transfer, and can intuitively simulate the dynamic process of land transfer.\n**2. Modelling**\n   The model constructed by ABM method is called agent-based model. The model constructed in this study simulates the process of farmers' spontaneous land transfer in a village based on the understanding of the decision-making mechanism of farmers' land transfer. The core components of such models are agents (also known as agents) and rules of behavior. In the model, according to the turnover intention (determined by two factors, the degree of non-agriculture and the age of the household head), the farmers are divided into three types: transfer-in households, transfer-out households and non-transfer households. The rules of behavior of these three types of farmers are as follows: (1) The transfer-in household transfers to land from the transfer-out household with the adjacent land, and stops transferring to land when the operating area reaches its optimal operating scale. (2) When the transferee reaches a certain age level, it will reserve a certain proportion of land for the land needed to meet its own food rations and then transfer all the rest of the land, and the transferee less than the age level will transfer all the land; The transfer of land ceases when there is no land to be transferred. (3) Non-transferable households do not participate in land transfer.\n   Each iteration of the model starts with updating the circulation intention of all farmers. In a decision-making and action cycle, each individual of the two types of households carries out the transfer or transfer behavior according to certain rules, and the non-transfer households do not carry out any behavior. All the transferred farmers make decisions and actions according to the corresponding behavior rules one by one in random order, and all farmers update the land area, non-agricultural degree and age after the end. The completion of a cycle of the model is equivalent to the completion of a round of land transfer transactions. When all the transferred farmers have reached the optimal scale of operation or all the transferred farmers have no land available for circulation, the model will stop running.\n**3. Conclusions and policy implication**\n   The following conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, a mechanism of farmers' spontaneous land transfer is revealed: farmers' willingness to transfer increases with the increase of their non-agricultural degree, increases first with the increase of age and then decreases, so as to determine the transfer into households and transfer out of households. Second, compared with the econometric model of farmers' land transfer behavior, this model can more fully depict the heterogeneity of farmers' age, non-farm employment degree and cultivated land ownership, and more directly reflect the interactive transactions between transferred-in households and transferred-out households. Thirdly, the model can predict the transfer behavior of farmers and the results of village land concentration under different policies of agricultural land transfer support, carry out the pre-evaluation of the effect of policy implementation, and provide intuitive enlightenment for the formulation of agricultural land transfer policies. The preliminary application of this model shows its ability to depict the land transfer results under different scenarios such as changing the optimal management scale, canceling the ration field and changing the village scale. Under the simulation conditions with more actual data support, this model can be used to carry out more detailed policy simulation experiments, providing a targeted reference for policy formulation.\n**4. Contribution**\n   This study has three levels of marginal contributions: At the theoretical level, it reveals the behavioral mechanism of farmers to carry out spontaneous land transfer, and shows the dynamic process of land concentration in rural areas under the background of urbanization and aging labor force, which helps to scientifically understand the basic law of agricultural land transfer. At the method level, a simulation model is constructed to simulate the nonlinear land transfer behavior of heterogeneous farmers and investigate the bottom-up dynamic process of rural land centralization. This model can be used as a benchmark model to expand the circulation operation scenario that is more complex and closer to reality. At the practical level, it provides a useful tool for carrying out policy simulation experiments to evaluate the implementation effect of different rural land transfer policies.\n\n6月7日，中国经济管理领域的顶刊之一《管理世界》2023年第6期发表了熊航教授及其团队的研究论文“The Mechanism Underlying Farmers' Spontaneous Land Transfer: Simulation, Validation and Application”。\n\n**Citation**:\n熊航;江鹏;鞠聪;彭开丽;.农户自发性土地流转行为机制研究：仿真、验证与应用[J].管理世界,2023,06:71-85+99+86-89\n","categories":["news"]},{"title":"Hang Xiong and Georgiy Bobashev present at the Second Annual IGSS Workshop","url":"/news/2nd_ISSG_workshop/","content":"## <div class=\"mdh-post_flex_center_center\">Hang Xiong and Georgiy Bobashev present at the Second Annual IGSS Workshop</div>\n\nOn June 10, 2021, Prof. Hang Xiong (Huazhong Agricultural University), and Dr. Georgiy Bobashev (RTI International) were invited to participate in the Second Annual IGSS (Inverse Generative Social Science) Workshop, and give a presentation on “Testing hypotheses in Agent-based models”.\n\n“Computer simulations have the potential to provide a new approach to testing empirical hypotheses for social sciences studies.

The Occam razor principle becomes important especially when the number of validation observations is not very big. This approach allows one to develop efficient and simpler simulation models. We discuss the usefulness of this approach in applications to theoretical settings and practical simulation models in social science.”\n\n<div class=\"mdh-post_textAlign_center\">\n    <img class=\"mdh-post_block-item\" style=\"max-width: 80%;margin-bottom: 16px;\" src=\"/img/news/2nd_ISSG_workshop.svg\">\n</div>\n\n2021年6月10日，华中农业大学教授熊航与RTI International研究员Georgiy Bobashev受邀参加第二届IGSS（Inverse Generative Social Science）研讨会，并作“Testing hypotheses in Agent-based models”的演讲，指出计算机模拟有可能为社会科学研究提供一种检验经验假设的新方法。\n","categories":["news"]},{"title":"2023年社会仿真模拟国际研讨会","url":"/events/ISSS/ISSS2023/","content":"<h3 class=\"mdh-post_flex_center_center _excerpt_ignore\">International Symposium on Social Simulation 2023</h3>\n\nSocial simulation is increasingly used to investigate complex phenomena in social and economic systems.

2023.\n\nInternational agricultural trade is key to improving global food security. It ensures better access to more diversified and nutritious food, especially in low-income countries, and acts as a safety net against food shortages caused by climate risks, crises, political tensions and other shocks. However, recent supply chain disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather events and the war in Ukraine have posed serious challenges to international agricultural trade. Rising geopolitical risks, such as the China-US trade conflict and tensions between Russia and the West, are further challenging trade relations. Following a long period of reduced agricultural trade barriers, the global food economy could now be faced with growing isolation and autarky resulting from trade-restricting measures, such as sanctions and export restrictions.\n\nThe IAMO Forum 2023 is jointly organized with the German Agribusiness Alliance and the Leibniz ScienceCampus “Eastern Europe – Global Area” (EEGA), with the technical cooperation of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nThe conference language will be English.

mapping》探讨了新能源转型中ABM的应用与思考。韩教授认为在快速转型的时代，电力行业的结构性变化以及所涉及的行为者和受影响的利益相关者的高度分化和异质性需要新的研究视角，即智能体模拟与系统框图相结合。随后，考虑到碳定价机制的异质性、不确定性、相互作用与反馈，韩教授介绍了系统框图（systems mapping）以直观和定性的方式探索反馈，智能体模拟（Agent-based modeling）来定量探索异质性和动态性。将强化学习、拍卖算法与ABM进行结合，搭建最小成本优化模型。通过模拟各种不同能源的生产情况与碳排放的结果，从而计算能源生产过程中的碳税。最后，韩教授认为系统框图与ABM结合的新思维为分析能量转换提供了新视角，需要跨学科合作。系统框图分析表明，除了“强化效应”外，碳排放权交易体系(ETS)政策中可能存在“平衡效应”。碳税可能会为结构性变化提供更多激励，但也存在一定的不确定性。\n\n<div

mapping》探讨了新能源转型中ABM的应用与思考。韩教授认为在快速转型的时代，电力行业的结构性变化以及所涉及的行为者和受影响的利益相关者的高度分化和异质性需要新的研究视角，即智能体模拟与系统框图相结合。随后，考虑到碳定价机制的异质性、不确定性、相互作用与反馈，韩教授介绍了系统框图（systems mapping）以直观和定性的方式探索反馈，智能体模拟（Agent-based modeling）来定量探索异质性和动态性。将强化学习、拍卖算法与ABM进行结合，搭建最小成本优化模型。通过模拟各种不同能源的生产情况与碳排放的结果，从而计算能源生产过程中的碳税。最后，韩教授认为系统框图与ABM结合的新思维为分析能量转换提供了新视角，需要跨学科合作。系统框图分析表明，除了“强化效应”外，碳排放权交易体系(ETS)政策中可能存在“平衡效应”。碳税可能会为结构性变化提供更多激励，但也存在一定的不确定性。\n\n<div

林老师认为，香港科技大学的李中清、康文林教授研究团队基于《缙绅录》建立了一个结构化的数据库，林老师从地方志的角度建立另外一个来源的清代职官数据库，希望两种来源的数据库可以形成互补。同时，林老师介绍了数据库建设的历程，并总结了数据库的价值，即地方志时间上更为完整、记录更为准确、信息更为丰富。\n\n**北京大学光华管理学院董浩老师分享了个人对历史和社会科学微观数据的整合尝试经历。** 董老师将自身参与的数据库建设工作总结为三类，一是基于一手数据对同类型的数据的跨时间链接，二是同类型数据的跨国家、跨社会的一些连接，三是同一个时期内不同类型的数据整合分析。董老师针对这三类的尝试结合自身研究，细致讲解了东亚历史人口数据、当代中国家庭婚姻和社会流动趋势分析等研究成果的数据采集与分析方法。\n\n**浙江大学公共管理学院范晓光老师以“精英网络与阶层地位认同”为题分享了对当代学人数据集的建构。** 范老师分享了从2013年开始主持参与的一些数据库建设经历，并引出中国社会学家数据集的建构过程。范老师总结了社会学者数据库在内容、数据来源和数据结构方面的优势，最后提出数据库建设的相关思考，主要涉及样本代表性、信效度、共赢性，以及潜在的学者隐私安全问题。\n\n**清华大学公共管理学院孟天广老师介绍了清华大学计算社会科学与国家治理实验室的建设进展。** 孟老师介绍了清华大学文理交叉驱动的计算社会科学建设的基础，展示了实验室的概览与交叉学科建设，将数据作为底座形成了6个研究方向，有效推动了清华大学校内不同院系的合作。此外，实验室研发了具有自主知识产权的计算社会科学的数据平台，该数据平台通过整合涉及经济社会运行的海量数据，包括政策文件数据库、政府网站土地交易、地方领导干部研究、司法裁判文书等数据库，已支撑5000多位用户使用。同时，平台拥有专业的调查实验软件编制程序，长期从事社会科学实验和调查性研究，如2015和2018年中国50个城市随机抽样调查、2013-2017年中国地方党政干部调查、2020至今的数字与智能治理调查等。\n\n**浙江省大数据发展中心金加和主任基于浙江省公共数据平台建设经验，讨论了公共数据赋能计算社会科学发展，推进应用研究融合创新的路径。** 金主任提出，国家层面数据已经成为基础战略性资源和重要的生产要素，浙江省今年3月围绕公共数据发布地方性法规《浙江省公共数据条例》。在利用公共数据开展研究方面，浙江省大数据管理局通过运用创新大赛补助奖励合作开发等方式，鼓励利用公共数据安全发展科学研究，产品开发、数据加工等活动。同时，浙江省数据开放应用创新大赛已持续三年，吸引了中国移动等320家国企、浙江大学、浙江理工大学等多所高校参与。\n\n\n###

Some theoretical perspectives on calibration and validation of agent-based models</em> (Gary Polhill, The James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen, President of the European Social Simulation Association). Traditional quantitative modelling focuses on fitting mathematical functions to empirical data. The parameters of these functions adjust the shape the function forms as it maps its domain to its range. All of the mathematics around calibration and validation is thus necessarily focused on finding ‘the right’ values for these parameters and establishing the level of confidence we can reasonably have in the model’s predictions using those parameters. Although these matters are still relevant to agent-based models, there are important differences both in the style of modelling and the contexts in which the models are applied that merit attention, and mean there is more to the story of calibration and validation of ABMs than which function in R you should use.</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><i>Estimation of agent-baseds models&nbsp;</i>(Ernesto Carrella, University of Oxford). In this lecture, I will briefly summarise the advances in likelihood-free methods for estimating agent-based models and how they can be used to match parameters to data. Almost all techniques involve tracking a set of summary statistics and trying to minimize the distance between simulated summary statistics and the real ones. I will start by showing the sufficient conditions by which this process “works” (that is, estimated parameters converge to the “real” ones). I will then show a set of techniques to perform this estimation trying to tease out their strengths and weaknesses. I will show however how in practice identification problems are ubiquitous and how one can spot at least the most glaring examples. We will conclude discussing how estimation fits into the process of building simulations and in particular its relationship to validation and theory development more broadly.</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><em>Introduction to R and tidyverse for output analysis</em> (Nicolas&nbsp;Payette, University of Oxford). This lecture introduces basic functions of the tidyverse packages for data analysis in R used for simulation output analysis.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">11:30-1:30PM</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><em>The challenge exercise</em> (Simone Gabbriellini, University of Trento &amp; Nicolas Payette, University of Oxford). This lecture uses a model to present a puzzle and a challenge to participants.

Social Science，CSS）——方兴未艾且发展迅速，计算社会科学是计算机技术与大数据分析在社会科学中应用而形成的一个交叉研究领域，而计算性研究方法（计算机仿真、复杂网络分析等）的掌握往往成为研究者进入该领域一道难以逾越的门槛。\n\n华中农业大学宏观农业研究院与帝国理工大学城市系统实验室（Urban Systems Lab, Imperial College London）联合举办“计算社会科学方法论”暑期学校，帮助研究者掌握计算机仿真等计算社会科学研究工具，以降低进入该领域的门槛。本期暑期学校邀请了五位具有运用计算机仿真模型研究社会科学问题丰富经验的主讲人授课，提供零起点且系统完整的仿真建模理论、方法和应用培训。\n<!-- more -->\n美国RTI国际（RTI International）数据科学中心的统计学家Georgiy
