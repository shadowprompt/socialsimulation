### SNSC: Social Network Simulation and Computing
*Chairs: Jiang Wu (Wuhan University, jiangw@whu.edu.cn)*

***Scope***

The Special Interest Group on Social Network Simulation and Computing at ASSA aims to advance the modeling, simulation, and computation of social network behavior across a wide range of fields, including information science and mathematics, communication studies, business and organizational research, sociology, psychology, anthropology, applied linguistics, biology, and medicine. By utilizing techniques such as social network analysis, simulation, mathematics, statistics, network science, and computer science, the SIG-SNSC seeks to promote interdisciplinary research and development in this area. The scope of the SNSC includes, but is not limited to, multi-agent based social network modeling and analysis, large-scale community discovery, real-world complex networks, social media analysis, big data analysis on online social networks, etc.

***Aims and activities***

The aim of our endeavor is to shed light on intricate social phenomena through the use of social network modeling and simulation, while fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among researchers and practitioners in this domain. SNSC is committed to organizing a range of activities, including but not limited to: the SNSC methodology study group, seminar series, and the special session at the ASSA annual conference.

***Types of actions aimed at and expected results***

The SNSC activities are expected to yield the following outcomes: (1)Advancing the state-of-the-art in social network simulation and computing; (2) Raising awareness of the significance of social network simulation and computing in academia and industry; and (3) Promoting collaboration and knowledge exchange among researchers and practitioners in this field, by providing a platform for networking and information sharing.

***Tools/channels for communications***

We intend to organize methodology sharing and seminar events using various online platforms like Zoom, Tencent Meeting, or live streaming, and to facilitate in-person communication during the special session at the ASSA annual conference.
