## Conference
### ISSS 2023
### (2023 ASSA Annual Conference)

The Asian Social Simulation Association (ASSA) is pleased to announce the "Call for Posters" for our highly anticipated 1st Annual Conference. This conference aims to bring together researchers, scholars, and practitioners from various disciplines interested in social simulation and modeling.

We invite researchers and professionals to submit their poster presentations for the conference, which will be held at Huazhong Agricultural University on 27-28 Aug 2023. Posters are an excellent opportunity to showcase ongoing research, emerging ideas, and innovative approaches in the field of social simulation.

1. Agent-based modeling and simulation
2. Computational social science
3. Social network analysis
4. Game theory and strategic modeling
5. Urban and regional planning
6. Public policy analysis
7. Social dynamics and collective behavior
8. Environmental modeling
9. Economic and financial simulations
10. Healthcare and medical simulations

**Submission Guidelines:**
1. Abstract: Please submit an abstract of your poster presentation (maximum 300 words) that summarizes your research topic, objectives, methods, and expected outcomes.
2. Author Details: Include all authors' names, affiliations, and contact information.
3. Keywords: Provide a list of keywords (maximum 5) that best represent your research area.
4. Format: Posters should be prepared in A0 size (841 x 1189 mm) and oriented in portrait layout.
