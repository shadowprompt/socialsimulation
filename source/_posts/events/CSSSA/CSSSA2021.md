**About CSS:**
Computational Social Science (CSS) is a scientific discipline where computational methods, data analysis, and simulation models of social dynamics are employed to offer new insights into social phenomena beyond what is available with traditional social science methods. The CSS 2021 Conference will bring together international practitioners of CSS to present peer reviewed research using computational social science methods.
