Stephanie Forrest will present “**The Biology of Computation**”

Patrick Grim will present “**Wisdom of Crowds vs. Wisdom of the Few: Expertise versus Diversity across Epistemic Landscapes**” on behalf of Patrick Grim, Daniel J. Singer, Aaron Bramson, Bennett Holman & William J. Berger

**Speaker Bios:**
**Stephanie Forrest** works at Arizona State University, where she directs the Biodesign Center for Biocomputation, Security and Society, and she is a Professor in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI). Prior to joining ASU, she was Regents Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and served as Dept. Chair 2006-2011. Professor Forrest was educated at St. John’s College (B.A.), and The University of Michigan (M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science). She is currently a member of the External Faculty at the Santa Fe Institute, and served as Co-chair of its Science Board (2010-2013) and as Interim Vice President (1999-2000). She spent 2013-2014 as a Jefferson Science Fellow at the U.S. Dept. of State and is currently a board member of the Computing Research Association and Chairs its Government Affairs Committee.

Forrest’s research studies the biology of computation and the computation of biology, including work on computational immunology, computer security, automated software repair, evolutionary computation, and biological modeling. Some of her awards include: SFI Stanislaw Ulam Memorial Lectures (2013), UNM Annual Research Lecture (2012), ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award (2011), the Presidential Young Investigator Award (1991). She is a Fellow of the IEEE.

**Patrick Grim** is distinguished teaching professor emeritus at SUNY Stony Brook and philosopher in residence with the Center for Study of Complex Systems at the University of Michigan. He is author and editor of The Philosophical Computer; The Incomplete Universe—Totality, Knowledge, and Truth; Reflexivity: From Paradox to Consciousness; Beyond Sets; 5 Questions—Mind and Consciousness, founding editor of over 40 years of The Philosopher’s Annual and current editor of the American Philosophical Quarterly. Known for collaborative research work across disciplines, his recent work often employs computational modeling but spans philosophical logic, ethics, social and political philosophy, philosophy of law, theoretical biology, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science.

**About CSS:**
Computational Social Science (CSS) is a scientific discipline where computational methods, data analysis, and simulation models of social dynamics are employed to offer new insights into social phenomena beyond what is available with traditional social science methods. The CSS 2022 Conference will bring together international practitioners of CSS to present peer reviewed research using computational social science methods.
