**About CSS:**
Computational Social Science (CSS) is a scientific discipline where computational methods, data analysis, and simulation models of social dynamics are employed to offer new insights into social phenomena beyond what is available with traditional social science methods. The CSS 2023 Conference will bring together international practitioners of CSS to present peer reviewed research using computational social science methods.

This year, in the interest of realizing the potential of Computational Social Science to achieve broad impacts, we extend a special welcome to papers, posters, and discussions that address and/or demonstrate applied Computational Social Science.

**Awards:** This year we will have three awards. The award for Best Paper carries a $500 prize sponsored by the Computational Social Science Society of the Americas. The award for Exceptional Policy Analysis in a Poster carries a $300 prize sponsored by Complexity and Policy Studies (CAPS). The award for New Voices in CSS – given to impressive work by someone new to the conference – carries a $200 prize sponsored by the Computational Social Science Society of the Americas.

**Submissions:** The CSS Program Committee invites original papers and posters concerning computational models and analysis of social phenomena. Models from all social science disciplines are welcomed. All submissions, including posters, will be subject to peer review. The PC and conference organizers may request that submissions for papers be converted into posters depending on scheduling and content.

**Papers:** Papers should be between 3,000 and 5,000 words in length, including all ?gures, tables, notes, references, and appendices. ODD documentation of models is encouraged and can be attached to a submission without counting against the word limit. The paper submission deadline is June 30.

**Posters:** Poster submissions require only an ~800 word abstract for submission. They should be clearly marked as poster submissions in the title. Poster abstract submissions are due June 30.

**Special Interest Groups (SIG):** CSS2023 will include SIG sessions before the full conference. If you are interested in organizing a SIG workshop or tutorial, please send a brief description to css2023@computationalsocialscience.org by May 30th. SIG sessions can take a wide variety of forms, ranging from tutorials and workshops to group discussions or hackathons. SIGs that are approved by the conference organizers will be announced and provided with meeting space. When planning your SIG event please make sure to include an estimated duration of the event in your proposal. The deadline for SIG proposal submissions is May 30.

**Paper Publication:** All CSS2023 accepted papers are eligible for publication in the proceedings. Proceedings format and template can be found above.
