SUBMIT ABSTRACT
The conference
The International Conference for Computational Social Science (IC2S2) will be held at the MÃ¦rsk Tower of the University of Copenhagen, July 17-20, 2023. IC2S2 has emerged as the dominant conference at the intersection of social and computational science, bringing together researchers from around the world in economics, sociology, political science, psychology, cognitive science, management, computer science, statistics and the full range of natural and applied sciences committed to understanding the social world through large-scale data and computation.

The conference will begin with a one-day session of tutorials in a range of social and computational methods (July 17). This will be followed by a full-scale three-day conference (July 18-20) featuring research and researchers from around the world, across a broad range of relevant fields, and working on all areas of computational social science to advance its many frontiers.

Unlike important social computing and associated computer science conferences, the IC2S2 community actively balances and maintains a conversation between social and computational scientists which integrates technological advances and opportunities with social scientific rigor and insight.

The conference is organized in conjunction with the ACM Learning at Scale Conference.
