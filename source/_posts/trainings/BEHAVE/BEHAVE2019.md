<h3 class="_excerpt_ignore">Behave Summer School 2019</h3>

Jointly organised by **Behave Lab, GECS**â€“Research Group on Experimental and Computational Sociology (University of Brescia), and the **ESLS PhD Programme in Economic Sociology and Labour Studies** (University of Milan), this school aims to train students on NetLogo, the most popular platform to build Agent-Based Models (ABM), by using modelling examples from social science research.

**Full-day hands-on training from 9 am to 5 pm.**

The first week addressed to beginner or experts needing a refresh, the last three days advanced training on model calibration and ouput statistical analysis, with an intermediate **Sunday tutorial on R** for beginners.

Some classic ABMs will be coded from scratch in **NetLogo. No previous coding skills** required.

Assistance and customized **counselling** on personal research projects during the whole day.

Personal project presentations.

**A social dinner and other events** with drinks and food.

Students will be provided with the theoretical background on the use of ABM in social science research and will learn how to develop an ABM from scratch. The examples will be on social impact theory, culture dynamics and social network effects on individual beliefs. Individual activities and exercise will be combined with group activities. No prerequisite on computing is needed. Students are expected to join the training with their own laptop. Students are also encouraged to develop a customized project starting from a personal research idea: bring your own model or data if you have, and we will help you!
