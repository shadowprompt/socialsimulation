<h3 class="_excerpt_ignore">Behave Summer School 2020</h3>

Jointly organised by **Behave Lab, ESSA-European Social Simulation Association, GECS**–Research Group on Experimental and Computational Sociology (University of Brescia), the **ESLS PhD Programme in Economic Sociology and Labour Studies** (University of Milan) and supported by **Fondazione Grazioli and Collegio Universitario Luigi Lucchini di Brescia**, this school aims to train students on Agent-Based Models (ABM) in NetLogo by using modelling examples from social science research.

- Lectures + hands-on training with two virtual rooms in parallel for student assistance
- The first course addressed to beginner or experts needing a refresh, the second to advanced training on model calibration and ouput statistical analysis, with an intermediate sunday tutorial on R for beginners.
- Some classic ABMs will be coded from scratch in NetLogo. No previous coding skills required during the first course.
- Assistance and customized counselling on personal research projects during the course with leading experts.
- Personal project presentations.
- Students will be provided with the theoretical background on the use of ABM in social science research and will learn how to develop an ABM from scratch. No prerequisite on computing is needed. Students will be connected via ZOOM and will be trained with their own laptop. Students are also encouraged to develop a customized project starting from a personal research idea: bring your own model or data if you have, and we will help you! During the advanced course, students will be trained on empirical calibration of parameters with quantitative and qualitative data, validation techniques and model documentation. The last slot of the advanced training  will include a session on how to survive peer review and editors when trying to publish ABM studies in scholarly journals.

<td align="left"><em>What are we doing? Some theoretical perspectives on calibration and validation of agent-based models</em> (Gary Polhill, The James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen, President of the European Social Simulation Association). Traditional quantitative modelling focuses on fitting mathematical functions to empirical data. The parameters of these functions adjust the shape the function forms as it maps its domain to its range. All of the mathematics around calibration and validation is thus necessarily focused on finding ‘the right’ values for these parameters and establishing the level of confidence we can reasonably have in the model’s predictions using those parameters. Although these matters are still relevant to agent-based models, there are important differences both in the style of modelling and the contexts in which the models are applied that merit attention, and mean there is more to the story of calibration and validation of ABMs than which function in R you should use.</td>
<td align="left"><i>Estimation of agent-baseds models&nbsp;</i>(Ernesto Carrella, University of Oxford). In this lecture, I will briefly summarise the advances in likelihood-free methods for estimating agent-based models and how they can be used to match parameters to data. Almost all techniques involve tracking a set of summary statistics and trying to minimize the distance between simulated summary statistics and the real ones. I will start by showing the sufficient conditions by which this process “works” (that is, estimated parameters converge to the “real” ones). I will then show a set of techniques to perform this estimation trying to tease out their strengths and weaknesses. I will show however how in practice identification problems are ubiquitous and how one can spot at least the most glaring examples. We will conclude discussing how estimation fits into the process of building simulations and in particular its relationship to validation and theory development more broadly.</td>
